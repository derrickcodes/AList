This is an ArrayList (AList) that implements my ListInterface.  It has junit testing and also a main
method that demonstrates functionality via printing results.

This AList stores items in whatever random order they are entered.  It does not store them in a sorted
order and therefore I didn't find a binary sort to be useful here.

** idea **
write AListSorted to implement that stuff
